# E-commerce Back End 
  
## As a manager at an internet retail company, I want a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies so that my company can compete with other e-commerce companies. In this project, I need to create a E-commerce Back End that satisfies the following criteria: 
  1. When the database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password are added to an environment variable file, then it should be able to connect to a database using Sequelize.
  2. When schema and seed commands are entered, then a development database should be created and should be seeded with test data.
  3. When the command to invoke the application is entered, then the server should start and the Sequelize models should be synced to the MySQL database.
  4. When API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags are opened, the data for each of these routes should display in a formatted JSON.
  5. WHEN API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes are tested in Insomnia Core, then you should be able to successfully create, update, and delete data in the database.
